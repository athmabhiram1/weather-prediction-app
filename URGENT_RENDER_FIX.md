# 🚨 URGENT: Frontend Still Connecting to Localhost - Fix Required

## Problem Identified
Your frontend deployment logs show the error:
```
Unable to connect to weather service at http://localhost:5000
```

This means the **NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL environment variable is NOT set** in your Render frontend service.

## ✅ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Set Environment Variable in Render Frontend Service

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Find your Frontend service**: `weather-prediction-app-wt9d`
3. **Go to Environment tab**
4. **Add the environment variable**:
   - **Key**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://weather-prediction-app-1-gmxl.onrender.com`

### Step 2: Redeploy Frontend Service

After adding the environment variable:
1. **Click "Save Changes"** in Render
2. **Manually trigger a redeploy** or it will auto-redeploy
3. **Wait for deployment to complete**

## 🔍 How to Verify the Fix

### Before Fix (Current State):
- Frontend tries to connect to: `http://localhost:5000` ❌
- Error message: "Unable to connect to weather service at http://localhost:5000"

### After Fix (Expected State):
- Frontend connects to: `https://weather-prediction-app-1-gmxl.onrender.com` ✅
- Weather search should work properly

## 📋 Environment Variables Checklist

### ✅ Backend Service (`weather-prediction-app-1-gmxl`)
- No environment variables needed for basic functionality
- (Optional: `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` for real weather data)

### ❌ Frontend Service (`weather-prediction-app-wt9d`) - NEEDS FIXING
**Required Environment Variable:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://weather-prediction-app-1-gmxl.onrender.com
```

**Optional Environment Variables:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL_FALLBACK=http://localhost:5000
```

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Render Instructions

### 1. Access Your Frontend Service
- Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-your-frontend-service-id
- Or search for "weather-prediction-app-wt9d" in your dashboard

### 2. Navigate to Environment Settings
- Click on the **"Environment"** tab (left sidebar)
- This is where you manage environment variables

### 3. Add Environment Variable
- Click **"Add Environment Variable"**

- Click **"Save Changes"**

### 4. Redeploy
- Go to **"Events"** tab
- Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**
- Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

## 🔄 Alternative: Force Redeploy with Environment Variable

If the above doesn't work, you can also:

1. **Add a dummy commit** to force redeploy:
   ```bash
   echo "# Force redeploy" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Force redeploy with environment variables"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Ensure environment variable is set** in Render dashboard before the deployment completes

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test Locally First:
```bash
# Test with the production backend URL
export NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://weather-prediction-app-1-gmxl.onrender.com
npm run dev
```

### Test After Render Deployment:
1. Visit: https://weather-prediction-app-wt9d.onrender.com
2. Open browser DevTools → Console
3. Search for a city (e.g., "Mumbai")
4. Check console logs for:
   ```
   🔧 Frontend Configuration:
   - API Base URL: https://weather-prediction-app-1-gmxl.onrender.com
   ```

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue 1: Environment Variable Not Taking Effect
- **Solution**: Make sure to click "Save Changes" and wait for auto-redeploy

### Issue 2: Still Shows Localhost
- **Solution**: Clear browser cache or open in incognito mode

### Issue 3: CORS Errors
- **Solution**: Your backend is already configured for CORS, should work fine

## ✅ Expected Final Result

After setting the environment variable and redeploying:

1. **Frontend URL**: https://weather-prediction-app-wt9d.onrender.com
2. **Backend URL**: https://weather-prediction-app-1-gmxl.onrender.com
3. **Connection**: Frontend → Backend (working) ✅
4. **Weather search**: Functional ✅

## 📞 If You Need Help

If the issue persists after setting the environment variable:

1. **Check Render logs** for the frontend service
