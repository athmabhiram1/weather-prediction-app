# 🚨 URGENT: CORS Issue Fixed!

## 🔍 Problem Identified
The frontend is now correctly connecting to the backend URL, but getting blocked by CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy. The backend doesn't have your frontend URL in its allowed origins list.

## ✅ Solution

### Step 1: Set Backend Environment Variable
In your **Backend Service** on Render, you need to add the frontend URL to the allowed CORS origins:

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Open your **Backend Service** (weather-prediction-app-1-gmxl.onrender.com)
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Add this environment variable:

```
Key: FRONTEND_URL
Value: https://weather-prediction-app-wt9d.onrender.com
```

### Step 2: Alternative Quick Fix
If you want to allow all origins temporarily for testing, add:

```
Key: ADDITIONAL_CORS_ORIGINS
Value: https://weather-prediction-app-wt9d.onrender.com,*
```

⚠️ **Note**: Using `*` allows all origins - only use for testing!

### Step 3: Redeploy Backend
After adding the environment variable:
1. Go to your backend service
2. Click **Manual Deploy** → **Deploy latest commit**
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## 🔧 What This Fixes

**Current CORS Origins** (from backend logs):
- `http://localhost:3000` (development)
- Default placeholder URLs
- ❌ **Missing**: `https://weather-prediction-app-wt9d.onrender.com`

**After Fix**:
- ✅ All current origins
- ✅ **Added**: `https://weather-prediction-app-wt9d.onrender.com`

## 🎯 Expected Result

After setting the environment variable and redeploying:

1. ✅ Frontend connects to correct backend URL
2. ✅ CORS allows the connection
3. ✅ Weather searches work properly
4. ✅ API calls succeed

## 🔍 How to Verify

1. **Check Backend Logs**: After redeployment, you should see your frontend URL in the CORS origins list
2. **Test Frontend**: Weather searches should work without connection errors
3. **Browser Console**: No more CORS error messages

## ⚡ Quick Test

You can test this quickly by temporarily adding a wildcard origin:

```
ADDITIONAL_CORS_ORIGINS=*
```

If this works, then replace it with your specific frontend URL for security.

**The fix is simple - just add the environment variable and redeploy the backend! 🚀**
